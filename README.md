# Logging on to the Most Awesome Conferencing Service

Welcome to my video conferencing server, _zhum_. This is not to be confused with [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com), an inferior and big brotherish service that spies on you and sells your data.

This server runs [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/), an open-source WebRTC server that is encrypted and self-hosted by moi right here in Austin, TX.

The connection guide below will set you up with the `vanstolk` meeting room but you are welcome to create your own room to meet with friends as well if you'd like.

#### How to Connect

- [Desktop Browser](#browser)
- [Android](#android)
- [iOS](#ios)

# Browser

- Go to https://zhum.xyz. _Make sure there is a `s` after `http`, and there is no `www` preceeding the url_.
